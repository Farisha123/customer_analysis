***CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION***

   
Machine learning methodologies are a great tool for analyzing customer data and finding insights and patterns. 
Artificially intelligent models are powerful tools for decision-makers. They can precisely identify customer
segments, which is much harder to do manually or with conventional analytical methods.

This is the final project of the project series in the Machine Learning . In this project, I applied
unsupervised learning techniques to identify customers bhaviour and also clustered the customers
based on some features. These segments can then be used to modifiying the approach of company towardes
customers .
